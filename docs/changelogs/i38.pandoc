### [#1149] Correctly handle facebook friends without names

Sometimes facebook friends come back without a name node.
These people really seem to have no associated name on their facebook page also.
Roar was expecting a name field, and failing on such friends.
    
We now just return an empty string for the name if the name is missing.
