i23 to i24
==========

-- New Features --

 * [#997] Added achievement info to /info/user

          You can now get information about what achievements other players
          have completed by calling `/info/user/`.  This info comes back in an
          achievements block, using the new attributes style for achievements,
          rather than the old (depreciated) tags format

 * [#996] Added info about the corresponding task to achievements

          Any call that returns information about an achievement will now have
          two additional attributes for each achievement `task_ikey` and
          `task_label`, containing information about the corresponding task. 

 * [#983] Gifts now report their label

          Any call that returns information about a gift from the globally
          available gifts should now contain an additional `label` tag for the
          item.

-- Bug Fixes --

 * [#986] Added achievement info to /user/achievements as attributes.

          `/user/achievements/` was using a format inconsistent with the other
          calls, returning its values as element, rather than as attributes.
          For now it doubles up and uses both elements and attributes, however
          the old element version should be considered depreciated and may be
          removed in future.

-- Depreciated Features --

 * [#986] Added achievement info to /user/achievements as attributes.

          With the new format for `/user/achievements` (see above) the element
          entries in `/user/achievements/` should be considered depreciated.
