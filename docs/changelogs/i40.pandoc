## New Features ##

### [#1156] Added support for multiple google app ids
There are some cases where the same google application might be accessed using 
multiple different application ids. Roar was unable to accept tokens from these
games due to only accepting a single application id. 

Roar will now accept a space seperates list of application ids, and will accept tokens
from any of these ids.
