### [#621] Added `admin/increment_stat`
This works just like `admin/set_stat`, except it increments or decrements the
corresponding stat.

### [#1081] Players notified when they gain an item
When a player recieves an item through any means they will get a notification
in the server block that looks like this:

~~~    
<item_add item_id="1478812237" item_ikey="item_ikey_1"/>
