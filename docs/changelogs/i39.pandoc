## Bug Fixes ##

### [#1151] Fixed logging bug that was generating excess log entries

These extra log entries were consuming large amounts of space on some servers and causing space issues.

### [#1152] Empty publishes were failing 

Empty publishes (those with no changes) were failing with odd messages about git. These empty 
publishes are now behaving correctly.
