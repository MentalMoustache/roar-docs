# `misc.xml`

This file controls miscellaneous aspects of the server behaviour. At the moment the only entry controls whether to track player xp as a leaderboard value.

Typically the file looks like this:

~~~
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<chameleon_data>
  <misc>
    <track_xp value="true" />
  </misc>
</chameleon_data>
